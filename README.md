# About

This is a showcase of the animations/small projects ideas I try to recreate in React Native with an amazing [@shopify/react-native-skia](https://github.com/Shopify/react-native-skia). I plan to add more examples in both Skia and React Native Reanimated (where possible) to compare the code complexity between the two.
